# Chat-List-Using-LRU-Cache-WhatsApp-

Implemented a chat application chat list using Least Recently Used Cache. An LRU cache is designed by combining two data structures: a Doubly Linked List and a Hash Map. It provides insertion, deletion, and searching in constant time. When a message from a new chat arrives, it will be inserted at the top of the chat list. If the message is from an existing conversation, then it will update the chat position to the top.
